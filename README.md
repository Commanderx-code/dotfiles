# MyFish – MyFish Environment & Restore Framework

MyFish is my personal Linux environment built on top of Zorin / Ubuntu,
managed through this `MyFish` repo.

It gives me:

- 🔁 **Full environment restore** on any machine
- 💻 **Custom shell + terminal setup** (fish, starship, fastfetch, themes)
- 📦 **Package restore** (APT/Nala, Flatpak, Homebrew)
- 💾 **Automated backups** with pruning + dedicated Git branch
- 🧪 **Custom MyFish ISO** that can auto-restore this environment on first boot

This repo is both my **dotfiles** and my **“mini config management system”**.
