# Publishing tools to Commander Toolbox

`toolbox.json` is this repository's exported Toolbox menu. Commit the configuration
and its catalog entry together, then push to `main`. Toolbox checks for updates
at minutes 17 and 47 each hour and adopts the current source revision only after
this repository's `check.yml` push workflow succeeds. Failed or unfinished checks
leave the previous Toolbox source version in place. GitHub may delay scheduled runs.

Toolbox regenerates its menus, runs compatibility tests, builds the Linux x86_64
application, and publishes a release with a checksum. Existing installations pick
up the new menu after updating Toolbox; run the relevant installer to apply the
configuration. Installing an application locally does not export it automatically.

## Update an existing tool

Edit its tracked configuration or installer and push normally. Built-in catalog
entries retain their dedicated Toolbox installers. Myfish's shell entries run the
updated Myfish installer, including any new tools it manages.

NetWatch, TFM and Spotify Cassette use dedicated Nix handlers. Their pinned
packages live in [home-manager/terminal-tools.nix](home-manager/terminal-tools.nix),
shared by Home Manager and Toolbox; see the [setup notes](configs/terminal-tools/README.md).

## Export a new application configuration

Add a `config` entry to the `entries` array in `toolbox.json`. For example, after
adding an actual `configs/btop/btop.conf` file:

```json
{
  "id": "btop",
  "name": "Btop Monitor",
  "description": "Install Btop and the shared monitor configuration.",
  "type": "config",
  "packages": {
    "apt-get": ["btop"],
    "dnf": ["btop"],
    "pacman": ["btop"]
  },
  "files": [
    {"source": "configs/btop/btop.conf", "target": "btop/btop.conf"}
  ]
}
```

- `id`: stable lowercase identifier with letters, numbers and hyphens.
- `name`: unique menu label across Toolbox; `description` explains the install.
- `packages`: distro package names, separately for each supported package manager.
  An empty array supports configuration-only installation on that manager; omit a
  manager to reject it. Nala uses the `apt-get` entry. Packages must exist in the
  user's enabled repositories; the installer does not add repositories.
- `files`: tracked source files or directories, relative to this repository.
  Targets are relative to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (normally `~/.config`). Export only the
  configuration needed by the tool. Symlinks and paths outside the repo are rejected.

Toolbox displays the new entry automatically. Its installer asks for `APPLY`,
validates all paths, installs the declared packages, then copies configuration
with backups. Home Manager-owned symlinks are refused before package changes.
Directory exports replace the destination directory with a backup; use individual
files to preserve unrelated files alongside them. Multiple file copies are not a
single transaction: earlier successful copies retain their backups if a later copy
fails.

The `builtin` type references an existing dedicated Toolbox handler. Keep those
entries when editing the catalog. Tools requiring custom system services, boot
changes or a special installer still need an appropriate Toolbox handler; this
catalog's generic installer manages distro packages and user configuration only.

## Check the automation

Open [Toolbox source synchronization](https://github.com/Commanderx-code/commander-toolbox/actions/workflows/sync-sources.yml).
**Run workflow** checks immediately. The workflow summary/log shows which source
revision was accepted or is waiting for CI. Builds appear under
[Toolbox releases](https://github.com/Commanderx-code/commander-toolbox/releases).
No extra cross-repository token is needed for these public repositories.

GitHub disables scheduled workflows in public repos after 60 days without repo
activity; re-enable the workflow in Actions if necessary. New source repositories
must be explicitly connected to the sync workflow; it watches dotfiles and Myfish.
